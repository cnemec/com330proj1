My background.
My history is very normal almost as if I was supposed to be the self insert or basically character you are supposed to be connected to in a movie.
I had both my parents and a few brothers due to being the middle child I ended up at some point being seen as the smart one. I don't remember why this title got applied to me but it did.
Since I was young I of course wanted to hold true to this standard partly out of a legitimate interest, pride and sibling rivalry.
Eventually I started taking programming classes in high school and honestly loved it, after that I figured computer science would be a great career for me.
