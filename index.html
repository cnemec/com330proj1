  <h1>The main short essay about history</h1>
  <h2>The importance of history</h2>
  <p> Now the background of a person is what makes them who they are. Some say it means much more than one's ambitions as it is what causes it all.
    Their favorite food, their hobbies, their ideal traits for a partner, their ambition these are all caused by ones history.'
    Learning about ones past is the best way to understand them hence why anthropology isn't treated like a psuedoscience.
    If you know someones history it is safe to say you have a solid understanding of them.
  </p>
  <h2>The importance of birthplace</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Now you may say that I am writing these two paragraphs about the importance of parts of one's lives so my specific life will be less detailed</em>
    So where one grows up says a lot, every place has slightly different beliefs, different foods, different education, sports ect.
    Where one grows up has a great effect on them, obviously, what they are exposed to will change their interests, and upon those interests will build aspirations.
    While someone's whose town is mostly farmland might grow up to have other interests their exposure to one kind of life makes the leap harder.
    So a more varied life will lead to someone with a more realized aspirations and interests.

  <h2>My origins</h2>
  <p>
    I grow up close to chicago but in more of a small town. I had room to roam around, go for walks, and generally enjoy the peaceful forests.
    While it was a town as opposed to the city of course there were less places like clubs or big areas, instead mainly small businesses, malls and school.
    Due to being a child and not having a huge spending budget for myself I of course ended up getting into video games. While they were much more expensive then comics
    they were also much more reusable, and would be used much longer. As such a lot of what I experienced in life had to do with coding, while I was never doing it the
    idea of what I can do with code is inspiring. I really only understood that they were code due to the show digimon which I loved as a kid. This led me to wanting to become a jack of trades in programming.
    To be able to program anything with a fair bit of understanding hence I became a computer science student.

  <h2>aspirations for class</h2>
  <p>
    I want to be able to make a good looking website one that will help me land a nice job. Also a good sense of aethetics would help me on solo projects I do for fun.
    It can help me land a internship that'll let me finally get my foot in the door of an industry I love, at least the idea of it. If I become more capable of creating interfaces that anyone can use I
    will be able to make anything I do look good. When a lot of websites do not understand this asking you to download the app because the mobile interface is terrible there is some use.
    Granted that might be because they just want to strong arm people into getting the app. Either way making better looking sites is the main priority.
