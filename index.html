  <h1>The story</h1>
  <h2>The background and aspirations of cnemec</h2>
  <article class="pre-college">
    <h3>My childhood background</h3>
    <p>The story of my childhood is fairly normal but it still is a good basis
     to understand how I got to where I am today.
    I had a few brothers, one was both athletic and much more social then I was,
    which caused me to become the smart one, mostly due to me having more time to study.
    While at first this didn't mean much as we were both children a notable
     difference slowly formed over the years I went into STEM and he went into business.
    Now this didn't specifically lead me down computer programming as STEM could
     give me a wide array of careers. The reason I choose computer programming is
     my love for video games which were my main hobby at the time and even now.
    Being around something so involved with coding from a young age led me to
    choosing the field. The classes I took in programming in highschool
    only made me more sure.
    </p>
    <h3>My college choice</h3>
    <p>At first my college choice was not IIT, like most people at my school I
    knew nothing about it despite being so close. I was gonna go to UCF,
    a college in florida I had family there and some programs looked nice.
    Eventually my dad recommended IIT and the proximity to home and Chicago was
    tempting but not enough. That all changed when I went to UCF in person, the
    heat was terrible I couldn't stand it.
    In ten minutes I felt very sweaty and tired, as such I knew I could never
    possibly stay there it was too hot for an Illinois boy. Though afterwards I
    still wasn't sure which chicago university to go to IIT was of course in the lead.
    But when I went to IIT learned its history and saw the buildings I knew it
    would be perfect for me. The historic architecture, teh inventor of the cell
     phone, and the beautiful view of the greatest city on earth. I knew instantly
     this was the school for me.

  <h3>My change in perspective</h3>
  <p>At first my classes were chosen solely based on what I needed to fill on my
     transcript. The teachers were not important, the classes were just what I
     needed to learn. This mostly changed recently when I was involved with a
     car accident.
    Obviously that wasn't the only part but being outside of class allowed me
    to see a sudden shift of the students in one.
    I classes were mostly a place to learn and I took the specifics for granted.
     I understood how hard classes would be when completely seperate from the school.
    I knew I needed to take classes I was more passionate in and needed to make
    sure I have teachers I will be able to effectively communicate with.
  </p>
  <h3>My aspirations</h3>
  <p>My biggest goals for this class is to learn how to create great UIs and a
    website that will help me get a leg up on my competition when I am looking
    for a job, hopefully to make up for my lack of a facebook account.
    Both of which will help with my passions that would be working as a
    programmer with a fairly good wage and steady job. I want to be able to look
     at the website I created with pride knowing it helped me get to where I am at the time.
    I feel like presentation is extremely important in the hunt for jobs and
    one's life in general. Yet another thing I learned through programming
    through hackathons. You can have the most interesting code but if it's
    affects aren't that obvious it'll be passed over.
    Hopefully this class will help me achieve my dreams and help me give back
    to the greatest city and greatest college on earth.
