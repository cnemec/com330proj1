  <h1>The story</h1>
  <p>
    Some say that when writing a webpage about yourself you should be honest.
    Some others say it's my website let me have fun with it. Those others are me.
    <em>Everything I will write from this point on is a lie</em>
    As the true most interesting man in the world I have much to say.
    Like the time I was summoned in a grand war for a holy grail.
    Where I fought other heroes of legend all longing for the grail.
