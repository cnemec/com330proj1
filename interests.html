  <h2>The misleading summary</h2>
  <h3>The disclaimer</h3>
  <p>
    As opposed to being about a list of interests for now I will make it merely
    describing one so it sounds like another.
    Possibly due to this being an interesting writing exercise that shows just
    how similar some films are as a base, or how being vague enough can make 2
    different films seem like clones.
    <i>Also of course because it makes it easier to use multiple types of text more organically.</i>
    Which is a great use of practice makes the experimentation that leads to grown feel natural.
    <em>Everything I will write from this point on is unrelated</em>
  </p>
  <h2>The war</h2>
  <p>
    <i> Try to guess which movie for fun.</i>
    It all started where the last film ended. Almost eerily so as if they wanted to make
    sure the cast had no time inbetween films, <i>well in universe they obviously
      all had other projects in real life.</i>
    The villians were easily able to overpower the heroes taking the lives and
    knocking out the guards like nothing.
    When all seemed lost they managed to send away 2 minds in order for them to
     get the help they need.
    The film then cuts to follow the journey of a man unsatisfied with their
    current life wanting to get further along in their true goals.
    While not being the one saught after they wull be the help needed.
    At first the man is unwilling to leave they have too many responsibilities
     at home and a journey frankly scares them right now.
    Then they realize just how big of a threat they face so they leave the
    planet with the help of friends they just met that day.
    Friends who didn't like them at first but eventually see them as worthy allies.
